Overview
This is a solution to the Sortable Project by Hassan Ouda

Running the Code
This solution requires Python 3.6, and uses only the standard library. Clone the repo, and python product_listings.py should work.
The results will generate a file called results.txt and will took around 2 minutes on my local computer.

Files
product_listings.py is the implementation of the algorithm tahat will perform the matching, and contains the high-level comments for the algorithm. 
Products.txt - The data for the 700+ products
Listings.txt - The data for all of the 20K + listings
